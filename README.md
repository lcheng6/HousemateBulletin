# HousemateBulletin

A social network for a housemates of 4, built with JQuery, AJAX and Google Firebase

##Purpose
What we have set out to do is to create a social network for a house of 4 roommates.  Initially we set out to create a small Facebook clone, in which we can share pictures within the group of housemates.  

Once we successfully implemented this post feature, we realized that posting images are not all that stimulating.  Facebook does it, Instagram does it, every and all social network does it.  Thus we set out to explore some unique use cases that solves some problem a house of 4 people have. 

We thought about the interaction of 4 housemates.  Back when we had roommates, we would use a bulletin board to target activities toward some weekend event, i.e. BBQ, hangout at the beach, house party.  All of this required all housemates to pitch in; and do some things to contribute the common end.
